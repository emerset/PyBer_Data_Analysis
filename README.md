# PyBer_Data_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to review the driver and ride data, summarizing comparisons by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). This is in order to determine any disparities and provide consequent recommendations.

## Results

Please refer to the following table outlining the totals and averages by city type:

![Data Summary by City Type](Resources/pyber_data_summary_by_city_type.png?raw=true "PyBer Data Summary by City Type")

Comparing the Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares by percentage we can see that while the percentages of total rides and total fares appear to match up fairly similarly, the percentage of total drivers by city type varies significantly in contrast to rides and fares.

We can also see from the data above that the average fare per ride is highest in rural cities and lowest in urban cities. This is expected as rural cities tend to have longer rides and fewer avilable riders. The average fare per driver in urban cities is also lowest, while the average fare per driver in rural cities is highest. This also is expected.

We can also see that the total weekly fares by city type does not vary significantly week over week.

## Summary

### 1) Increasing driver count in rural and suburban cities.
While urban cities have the highest supply and demand for PyBer rides, we are seeing a disparity with supply of drivers in urban cities and supply of drivers in rural and suburban cities, in comparison to the total rides in each of these city types. We believe that this this is a pain point that could be addressed by focussing on increasing the drivers in rural and suburban cities.

### 2) Increasing Total Fares by focussing on average fare per ride.
The average fare per ride for urban cities is lower than it should be. We believe that most rides happen during rush hour and that the target audience cares more about fast and efficient rides than about saving a dollar. We do not have the data to determine if pricing increases during peak traffic and demand hours as we expect it to, however the data that we are seeing suggests that finding targeted ways to increase ride fares for urban cities at key points and times will cause the most significant increase in revenue for PyBer as well as the drivers.

### 3) Increasing average fare per driver in urban cities.
The average fare per driver is so low in urban cities that we would like to recommend a discussion on ways to increase this figure. This is in order to deter a race to the bottom for drivers in our app which will result in a decreased customer experience and will hurt the brand of the company in the long term.
